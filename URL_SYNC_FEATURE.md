# URL Synchronization Feature

## Overview

The search and filter system has been revamped to include comprehensive URL synchronization with enhanced persistence. Now when users apply filters or change search parameters, the results are immediately reflected in the URL and saved to localStorage, making it easy to share filtered results and maintain state across page refreshes and browser sessions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. URL Parameter Synchronization
- **Search Parameters**: Location, property type, price range, and bedrooms are now synced to the URL
- **Filter Parameters**: Min/max price, bathrooms, and amenities are included in the URL
- **Sort Options**: Current sort order is preserved in the URL
- **Pagination**: Current page number is maintained in the URL

### 2. Enhanced Persistence with localStorage
- **Automatic Backup**: All filter state is automatically saved to localStorage
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Filters persist across browser sessions and page refreshes
- **Smart Loading**: Filters are restored from localStorage on page load
- **URL Priority**: URL parameters take precedence over localStorage when both are present

### 3. Automatic Filter Application
- Filters are now applied automatically with a 300ms debounce
- No need for a separate "Apply" button - changes are immediate
- Better user experience with real-time filtering

### 4. Active Filters Display
- New `ActiveFilters` component shows currently applied filters
- Users can remove individual filters by clicking the X button
- "Clear all" option to reset all filters at once

### 5. User Feedback & Notifications
- **Persistence Indicator**: Shows when filters are being saved
- **Restore Notification**: Notifies users when filters are restored from previous session
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of filter state and persistence

### 6. URL Parsing on Page Load
- When users navigate to a URL with parameters, filters are automatically applied
- Supports both search parameters and filter parameters
- Maintains state across browser sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Custom Hook: `useURLSync`
Located in `client/src/hooks/use-url-sync.ts`

```typescript
const {
  filters,
  sortBy,
  currentPage,
  handleFiltersChange,
  handleSortChange,
  handlePageChange,
  handleRemoveFilter,
  clearAllFilters
} = useURLSync();
```

### Enhanced Persistence Features
- **localStorage Integration**: Automatic saving and loading of filter state
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Filters include timestamp for potential future cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable
- **Smart State Management**: Prevents conflicts between URL and localStorage

### Components Updated

   - Uses the `useURLSync` hook for state management
   - Includes `ActiveFilters` component
   - Includes `PersistenceIndicator` for user feedback

2. **PropertyFilters** (`client/src/components/property-filters.tsx`)
   - Debounced filter application
   - Removed "Apply" button for better UX
   - Automatic synchronization with URL and localStorage
   - Enhanced clear functionality

3. **PropertySearch** (`client/src/components/property-search.tsx`)
   - Enhanced to work with URL parameters
   - Supports initial search parameters

4. **ActiveFilters** (`client/src/components/active-filters.tsx`)
   - New component for displaying active filters
   - Individual filter removal functionality

5. **PersistenceIndicator** (`client/src/components/persistence-indicator.tsx`)
   - Shows when filters are being saved
   - Visual feedback for persistence status

6. **FilterRestoreNotification** (`client/src/components/filter-restore-notification.tsx`)
   - Notifies users when filters are restored
   - Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds

## URL Structure

### Example URLs
```
/properties?location=New%20York&propertyType=apartment&minPrice=500000&bedrooms=2&sort=price-low&page=2
/properties?priceRange=500000-1000000&bathrooms=2&amenities=parking,pool
/properties?location=Los%20Angeles&propertyType=house&maxPrice=2000000
```

### Parameter Mapping
- `location`: Search location
- `propertyType`: Property type filter
- `priceRange`: Price range from search (e.g., "500000-1000000")
- `minPrice`/`maxPrice`: Individual price filters
- `bedrooms`: Minimum number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Minimum number of bathrooms
- `amenities`: Comma-separated list of amenities
- `sort`: Sort order (newest, price-low, price-high, popular)
- `page`: Current page number

## Persistence Behavior

### localStorage Structure
```json
{
  "filters": {
    "location": "New York",
    "propertyType": "apartment",
    "minPrice": 500000,
    "bedrooms": 2
  },
  "sortBy": "price-low",
  "currentPage": 2,
  "timestamp": 1703123456789
}
```

### Loading Priority
1. **URL Parameters**: If URL contains parameters, they take precedence
2. **localStorage**: If no URL parameters, filters are loaded from localStorage
3. **Defaults**: If neither exists, default values are used

### Saving Behavior
- **Automatic**: Filters are saved to localStorage whenever they change
- **Debounced**: Saves occur after 300ms of inactivity to prevent excessive writes
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles localStorage unavailability

## Benefits

1. **Shareable URLs**: Users can share filtered results with others
2. **Browser Navigation**: Back/forward buttons work correctly with filters
3. **Bookmarkable**: Users can bookmark specific filter combinations
4. **Cross-Session Persistence**: Filters persist across browser sessions
5. **Page Refresh Persistence**: Filters survive page refreshes
6. **Better UX**: No need to reapply filters after navigation
7. **Visual Feedback**: Users know their filters are being saved
8. **Restore Notifications**: Users are informed when filters are restored

## Usage Examples

### From Home Page Search
1. User enters search criteria on home page
2. Clicks "Search Properties"
3. Navigates to `/properties` with search parameters in URL
4. Filters are automatically applied and saved to localStorage

### From Properties Page
1. User applies filters using the sidebar
2. URL updates automatically with filter parameters
3. Filters are saved to localStorage
4. User can share the URL with others
5. Page can be refreshed without losing filter state

### Cross-Session Persistence
1. User applies filters and closes browser
2. User returns later and navigates to `/properties`
3. Filters are automatically restored from localStorage
4. User sees notification that filters have been restored

### Individual Filter Removal
1. User sees active filters displayed as badges
2. Clicks X on any filter to remove it
3. URL updates automatically
4. localStorage is updated with new filter set
5. Results refresh with new filter set

## Future Enhancements

- Add filter presets for common combinations
- Implement filter history with multiple saved states
- Add URL shortening for complex filter combinations
- Support for advanced search operators
- Filter analytics and usage tracking
- Automatic cleanup of old localStorage entries
- Export/import filter configurations
